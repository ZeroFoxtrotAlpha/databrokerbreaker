privacy is cringe


basily it creates a unicode identity thats invisibleish that you assign with a basic unicode letter (english layout working rn), then you can use the generated word that has a binary missmatch to the typed input to identify your assigned letter. so if billy decides to copy paste that jazz it into something or sells your essay and it shows up as a w and thats what you assigned, the you can positivly id your intelectual property or private info as snached and trace the leak



the nerd deets:

"cаոоpіеԁ" for this exaple is tied to a "w" identifyer.

the binary ouyputs as "01100011 10000110000 10101111000 10000111110 01110000 10001010110 10000110101 10100000001"

when typed it should output as "01100011 01100001 01101110 01101111 01110000 01101001 01100101 01100100 00001010"

the off states are standard and the on states are replacements. 

"01100011 10000110000 10101111000 10000111110 01110000 10001010110 10000110101 10100000001" would translate to 01110111

01110111 is kinda a "w" according to me in oppinion and unicode as a fact
